So this is what storming the Autobahn at 250kmph must feel like. Pedal to the metal, the speedo needle
 was still climbing — until it topped out at an indicated 267kmph. I couldn’t hear much of the engine
 any more. Wind and road noise had taken over, drowning out the roar of the engine. And yet, the
 Volkswagen Golf GTI stayed rock solid. Planted. Unaffected by crosswinds. Funnily enough, the first
 (and only) time I drove on the Autobahn was in a Volkswagen Golf. More specifically, an e-Golf.
 Very different experience, I promise you. It was my first time in Germany, first time driving
 left-hand drive, heck, first time driving abroad. I was unsure of Autobahn etiquette so I refrained
 from going flat out in the fast lane. Wouldn’t want my weedy electric car in the crosshairs of a
 911 Turbo on its 300kmph morning commute, would I? This GTI, though, is a very different animal.
 It was a proper hot hatch.
